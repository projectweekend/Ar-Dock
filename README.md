This is a Raspberry Pi project that ties together a couple of my Arduino projects: [Ar-Starbug](https://github.com/projectweekend/Ar-Starbug) and [Ar-Nova-5](https://github.com/projectweekend/Ar-Nova-5). These three projects combine to replace two older projects: [Pi-Starbug](https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Starbug) and [Pi-Nova-5](https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Nova-5). The sensor logic for each older project has been moved off of the Raspberry Pi and onto Arduino. Now only a single Raspberry Pi is needed to communicate with both of the Arduino units. This new structure:

* Let's the Arduino do what it does best: run a small, fast loop and read data from various sensors. It communicates with the Raspberry Pi using both digital GPIO pins and serial data.
* Frees up one of my Raspberry Pis. Instead of using two, now I only need one. Also since this project is designed to report the data it collects back to another [home server project](https://github.com/projectweekend/Holly), the Pi is responsible for this part. Connecting an Arduino to the internet and sending data is misreably tedious in my opinion so why not use something else that does it better?
