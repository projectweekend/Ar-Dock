This is a Raspberry Pi project that ties together a couple of my Arduino projects: [Ar-Starbug](https://github.com/projectweekend/Ar-Starbug) and [Ar-Nova-5](https://github.com/projectweekend/Ar-Nova-5). These three projects combine to replace two older ones: [Pi-Starbug](https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Starbug) and [Pi-Nova-5](https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Nova-5). The sensor logic for each older project has been moved off of a Raspberry Pi and onto an Arduino. Now only a single Raspberry Pi is needed to communicate with both of the Arduino units. This new structure:

* Let's the Arduino do what it does best: run a small, fast loop and read data from various sensors. It communicates with the Raspberry Pi using both digital GPIO pins and serial when needed.
* Frees up one of my Raspberry Pis. Instead of using two, now I only need one. Also since this project is designed to report the data it collects back to another [home server project](https://github.com/projectweekend/Holly), the Pi is a perfect fit. Connecting an Arduino to the internet and sending/receiving data is misreably tedious in my opinion. The Pi does a much better job.

### Why is this called Ar-Dock?

When I started working on my first few Raspberry Projects I named them after ships from [Red Dwarf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf). Since the Pi and my favorite television program of all time both originated in the UK, it was a fun way to keep track of them. When I decided to move the sensor components over to Arduino, I kept the ship names. Now all of those Arduinos "dock" with this project to transfer information. Don't judge me monkey!
