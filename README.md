This project is dead, but I kept the empty repository around to preserve some history of how things evolved here. While rewriting some parts of this to use a messaging queue, and fully decouple its communication components from another project ([Holly](https://github.com/projectweekend/Holly)), I realized things needed to be broken down even further. Instead of having multiple services here in one place, it made more sense to separate items. Keeping each one small and focused made them more flexible and reusable.
